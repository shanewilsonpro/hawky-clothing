# Hawky Clothing
 I build this E-commerce website for clothing. This is good practice for me to learn full stack using React, Redux, GraphQL, Hooks, Firebase, and more. 

## What tools used for this project:
- React
- SASS (https://sass-lang.com/)
- Firebase
- Redux

- npx create-react-app hawky-clothing (for creating the project)
- For SASS, if you use npm, npm install node-sass or for yarn, yarn add node-sass
- For React routing, if you use npm, npm install react-router-dom (https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- For Firebase, npm install firebase
- Redux, npm install redux react-redux (https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation)
- Reselect from Redux, npm install reselect (https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)
- Persist from Redux, npm install redux-persist (https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
